Habanero 3d project is a 3d game engine, developed originally by a team
of students and alumni of Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and 
Mechanichs at University of Warsaw.

The project is a work-in-progress. Some of components still need 
polishing, while others require a full redesign and new implementations.

The team have decided to publish project's source. We are looking for
talented programmers to join Habanero 3d team. With any questions,
contact askalski via github.

Currently repository contains a Ubuntu compilable version of Habanero3d
Engine, with NetBeans project files and makefiles.

The Engine requires (not sure if it's a full list) following libraries
to compile (ubuntu names):

libsndfile1-dev
libopenal-dev
libxrandr-dev
libfreetype6-dev
libjpeg62-dev
cmake
mesa-common-dev
glew 
libsm-dev
libgl1-mesa-dev
libglu1-mesa-dev
libxxf86vm-dev

also SFML 2.0 RC ( http://www.sfml-dev.org/ ) and probably graphics 
card's drivers to provide OpenGL headers and .so files.

The MS Visual Studio project files are also included, but not functional
(outdated) at this moment.
